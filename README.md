## Description

Replicating the front page of a website.

### Learning Objective

Apply html and css best practices, using Sass to construct css code, with attention to responsiveness and breakpoints.

### Original website

Since Medium is a dynamic website, the screenshot does not necessarily reflect the state I was replicating.
